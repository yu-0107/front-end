                The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen.
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried.
Don't let them in, don't let them see.
Be the good girl you always have to be.
Conceal don't feel, don't let them know.
Well, now they know!
<br>
Let it go, let it go.
Can't hold it back anymore.
Let it go, let it go.
Turn away and slam the door.
I don't care what they're going to say.
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway.
It's funny how some distance,
makes everything seem small.
And the fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do,
to test the limits and break through.
No right, no road, no rules for me. I'm free!
<br>
Let it go, let it go.
I am the one with the wind and sky.
Let it go, let it go.
You'll never see me cry.
Here I stand, and here I'll stay.
Let the storm rage on.
<br>
My power flurries through the air into the ground.
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back; the past is in the past!
<br>
Let it go, let it go.
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand, in the light of day.
<br>
Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway</p>

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Yeah
<br>
I'd take the fall
I got you covered when there's no one at all
Oh, yeah, and I'd stay through the night
When you got demons tryna break through the walls
<br>
There ain't no, no kinda line
That I wouldn't cross if you need me to
You're out here searchin' for signs
So I think it's finally time that you knew
<br>
Nobody got you the way I do (Ooh)
Whatever demons you're fightin' through
When you need somebody to turn to
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do
<br>
Nobody, nobody, nobody (Ayo)
Got you the way I do
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody (Ayo)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do (Yeah, yeah)
<br>
When you go dark and the night gets so cold
I'll bе on my way to you (Oh yeah)
You know I ain't tryna lose you, oh, no
If you're in Hеll, I'll go there too
<br>
There ain't no, no kinda line
That I wouldn't cross if you need me to
You're out here searchin' for signs
So I think it's finally time that you knew
